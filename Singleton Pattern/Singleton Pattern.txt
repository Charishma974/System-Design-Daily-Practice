Question:- Our next stop is the Singleton Pattern, our ticket to creating oneof-a-kind objects for which there is only one instance. - not understood

Answer:- The Singleton Pattern is like a rule that says: “Only one object of this class can ever exist during the entire run of the program.”

🔑 Why would we want that?
Imagine you have a central controller in your app (like for logging, configuration, or DB connection). You don’t want multiple versions of it – just one that everyone shares.
That’s when Singleton comes in!

🧱 Real-life Analogy:
Think of the President of a country. Only one person can be the president at a time. If everyone could make their own president, there’d be chaos.
So, we ensure there’s only one — that’s a Singleton.

💻 Java Code Example:
public class Singleton {
    // 1. Create a private static instance of the class
    private static Singleton instance;

    // 2. Make the constructor private (so no one can use 'new')
    private Singleton() {
        System.out.println("Singleton Instance Created!");
    }

    // 3. Provide a public method to get the instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton(); // create only once
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Singleton obj1 = Singleton.getInstance();
        Singleton obj2 = Singleton.getInstance();

        System.out.println(obj1 == obj2);  // Output: true ✅
    }
}
🔄 What’s happening?
We don’t use new to create the object. We call getInstance() method. If it's already created, we get the same one again. So obj1 and obj2 both point to the same object.

Question:- There are many objects we only need one of: thread pools, caches, dialog boxes, objects that handle preferences and registry settings, objects used for logging, and objects that act as device drivers to devices like printers and graphics cards. In fact, for many of these types of objects, if we were to instantiate more than one 
we’d run into all sorts of problems like incorrect program behavior, overuse of resources, or inconsistent results.

Answer:- 
🧠 What it’s saying (in simple words):
    There are some objects in a program where we only need one. If we create more than one, it can cause bugs, errors, or waste system resources.

📦 Examples of such objects:
    1. Thread Pools 🧵
        Used to manage multiple tasks. If you have more than one, you might mess up task scheduling or overload the system.
    2. Cache ⚡
        Stores temporary data to avoid doing the same work again. If there are multiple caches, they might hold different data → inconsistent results.
    3. Dialog Boxes 💬
        A popup window. If your program opens 10 copies, it gets messy!
    4. Preferences / Settings Handlers ⚙️
        Like app settings. If two different objects change the settings differently → your app may behave unpredictably.
    5. Loggers 📜
        Used to keep track of what the app is doing. If multiple logger objects exist, logs might go to different places → hard to track bugs.
    6. Device Drivers 🖨️🎮
        For things like printers or graphics cards. If two driver objects try to talk to the device at the same time → conflict!

💥 What happens if we make multiple?
    ❌ Wrong behavior
    ❌ Too much memory or CPU used
    ❌ Conflicting or inconsistent data

✅ So what's the solution? Use the Singleton Pattern — it makes sure only ONE object of that kind is ever created.

Question:- The Singleton Pattern also gives us a global point of access, just like a global variable, but without the downsides.

Answer:- 👉 It gives us a way to access that single object from anywhere in the program — like a global variable.
Logger logger = Logger.getInstance();  // use it anywhere in the app

⚠️ “…just like a global variable, but without the downsides.”
👉 Global variables are dangerous because: They can be changed by anyone, anytime 😬. They make debugging hard
But with Singleton, you get the convenience of a global variable (one point of access), without the risks.

🔹 Feature                  | ✅ Singleton Pattern
One object only?            | ✅ Yes
Global access?              | ✅ Yes
Safer than global vars?     | ✅ Yes
Commonly used in real apps? | ✅ Absolutely (loggers, DB connections, etc.)

Question:- Well, here’s one example: if you assign an object to a global variable, then that object might be created when your application begins. Right? What if this 
object is resource intensive and your application never ends up using it? As you will see, with the Singleton Pattern, we can create our objects only when they are needed.

Answer:- 
difference between a global variable and a singleton pattern

1. Global Variable Example:

class GlobalExample {
    static ExpensiveObject globalObject = new ExpensiveObject();
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Global Variable Example:");
    }
}

class ExpensiveObject {
    ExpensiveObject() {
        System.out.println("ExpensiveObject created");
    }
}

Explanation: In this case, globalObject is created as soon as the program starts. Even if you never use it, it's consuming resources, and the object is created right away.

2. Singleton Pattern Example:

class SingletonExample {
    private static ExpensiveObject singletonObject = null;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Singleton Pattern Example:");
        ExpensiveObject object1 = SingletonExample.getInstance();
        ExpensiveObject object2 = SingletonExample.getInstance();
        System.out.println(object1 == object2);
    }
    public static ExpensiveObject getInstance() {
        if (singletonObject == null) {
            singletonObject = new ExpensiveObject();
        }
        return singletonObject;
    }
}

class ExpensiveObject {
    ExpensiveObject() {
        System.out.println("ExpensiveObject created");
    }
}

Explanation: The ExpensiveObject is created only when you call getInstance() for the first time. After that, the same instance is reused. In this example, the ExpensiveObject is created only when you actually need it, not at the start of the program.
