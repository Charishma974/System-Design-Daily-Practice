Question:- The word interface is overloaded here. There’s the concept of interface, but there’s also the Java construct interface. You can program to an interface, without 
having to actually use a Java interface. The point is to exploit polymorphism by programming to a supertype so that the actual runtime object isn’t locked into the code. 
And we could rephrase “program to a supertype” as “the declared type of the variables should be a supertype, usually an abstract class or interface, so that the objects 
assigned to those variables can be of any concrete implementation of the supertype, which means the class declaring them doesn’t have to know about the actual object types” 

Not understood

Answer:- 

🔁 The Word "Interface" is Overloaded This just means "interface" has two meanings:
      General concept: Like "a boundary" or "a way to interact with something."
      Java keyword: The actual interface keyword in Java (interface FlyBehavior { ... }).

💡 Main Point: "Program to an interface"
      This phrase doesn’t have to mean "use the interface keyword in Java."
It means:
      Write your code so that it depends on a more general type (like an abstract class or interface), not a specific one.

✅ Why Do This? Let’s look at two examples.

❌ Bad way (programming to a concrete type):
      FlyWithWings fw = new FlyWithWings();
      fw.fly();
You're stuck with FlyWithWings forever. You can’t change the behavior easily.

✅ Good way (programming to a supertype):
      FlyBehavior fb = new FlyWithWings();
      fb.fly();
Now fb could be: new FlyWithWings() || new FlyNoWay() || new FlyAsRobot()

The code is flexible, extensible, and follows polymorphism.

🔄 So When They Say... "You can program to an interface, without having to actually use a Java interface."
It means: 
    You can declare your variables using an abstract class or an interface type, not a specific class—so you’re not “locked in” to any one implementation.

🔧 Real-World Analogy
Imagine you're plugging in a device (phone charger, lamp, etc.): You're not coding to a specific device. You're just using the socket (interface).
Anything that matches the socket can be plugged in.

Same thing here. Your code doesn’t care what's behind the socket, as long as it follows the contract (fly() method, etc.).

🧠 Summary in One Line
"Program to a supertype" just means:
Use variables of type interface or abstract class, and assign them objects of any concrete class that implements it.

Question:- what is the main problem with inheritance that i can explain in interview
🔥 Main Problems with Inheritance
            Tight Coupling – Subclasses depend heavily on the base class.
            Fragile Base Class – Changes in the base class can break subclasses.
            Inflexibility – Hard to change or reuse part of the inherited behavior.
            Single Inheritance Limitation – Can't inherit from multiple classes.
            Hierarchy Overgrowth – Leads to deep, complex class hierarchies.
            Code Duplication Across Unrelated Classes – No reuse if there's no common parent.
            Violates Open/Closed Principle – Requires modifying base class to add behavior.
            Inherits Unwanted Behavior – Subclass may get methods it doesn't need.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Composition

Question:- When you put two classes together like this you’re using composition. Instead of inheriting their behavior, the ducks get their behavior by being composed with 
the right behavior object. 

Answer:- 
📦 What is Composition? Composition means putting one object inside another to use its behavior.

🔁 Inheritance vs Composition
            Concept	            Example	                            Meaning
            Inheritance	      class Duck extends FlyWithWings	Duck is a FlyWithWings (not ideal)
            Composition	      class Duck { FlyBehavior fly; }	Duck has a FlyBehavior (preferred)

🧠 Why Composition is Better Here
      You can swap behaviors at runtime.
      It’s more flexible and reusable.
      You avoid tightly coupling behavior to one class.

✅ Final One-Line Summary
Instead of inheriting flying and quacking, the duck uses those behaviors by containing them as objects—that’s composition.

Question:- The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from 
clients that use it.

Answer:- 
💡 Simple Explanation:
            Strategy Pattern lets you define multiple ways to do something, put each in a separate class, and switch them at runtime without changing the main class.

🔧 In parts:
      "Defines a family of algorithms"
            → You create different versions of some behavior.
            Example: FlyWithWings, FlyNoWay, FlyAsRobot are all different fly algorithms.

      "Encapsulates each one"
            → Each behavior is put in its own class that implements an interface.
            Like FlyBehavior interface → multiple classes implement it.

      "Makes them interchangeable"
            → You can swap behaviors in and out (even at runtime).
            Example: duck.setFlyBehavior(new FlyNoWay()).

      "Vary independently from clients that use it"
            → The Duck class doesn’t care how flying or quacking is done.
            It just calls flyBehavior.fly() and trusts the behavior object to handle it.

🧠 One-Line Summary:
Strategy Pattern lets you swap parts of an object’s behavior dynamically by using interfaces and composition.

Question:- HAS-A can be better than IS-A

Answer:- 
✅ HAS-A vs IS-A
      IS-A → Inheritance (e.g., class Dog extends Animal)      
      HAS-A → Composition (e.g., class Car { Engine engine; })

🧠 In your duck code:
      class Duck {
          FlyBehavior flyBehavior;
          QuackBehavior quackBehavior;
      }
👉 This is a HAS-A relationship:

A Duck has-a FlyBehavior, A Duck has-a QuackBehavior

You're not inheriting flying or quacking—you're composing the duck with those behaviors.

💡 Why HAS-A is better here: You can change the behavior at runtime

You don’t need to modify the Duck class to add new fly types. Promotes flexibility and reuse

✅ So the answer: The Duck class uses HAS-A relationships with FlyBehavior and QuackBehavior by holding references to those interfaces.

Question:- The key is that a Duck will now delegate its flying and quacking behavior, instead of using quacking and flying methods defi ned in the Duck class (or subclass).
what does delegate mean?

Answer:- 
Great question! In this context, "delegate" means that instead of the Duck class (or its subclasses) doing something itself—like flying or quacking—it hands off the 
responsibility to another class or object that specializes in that behavior.

Think of it like this: If you're organizing a party and you delegate the music to a DJ, you're not handling the music yourself. You're saying:

"Hey DJ, you're in charge of the music. I’ll focus on the other stuff."

In code (especially object-oriented programming):
Rather than the Duck class having its own fly() / quack() methods with built-in logic, it uses other objects (say, a FlyBehavior or QuackBehavior) to perform those actions.

Example :
class Duck {
    FlyBehavior flyBehavior;
    QuackBehavior quackBehavior;

    void performFly() {
        flyBehavior.fly(); // Delegates flying to the flyBehavior object
    }

    void performQuack() {
        quackBehavior.quack(); // Delegates quacking to the quackBehavior object
    }
}
So if you want to change how a Duck flies or quacks, you just change the behavior object—not the Duck itself.
